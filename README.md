# Simple-N-Tier-Solution

This repository illustrates the basic concept of dividing an application into separate layers, commonly known as N-Tier architecture. 

## Overview

N-Tier architecture divides an application into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. This separation promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

### Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction and presentation logic.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core functionality and business rules of the application.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages data access and storage, interacts with databases or external services.

## Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **PresentationLayer**: Handles user interfaces and interactions.
  - **BusinessLogicLayer**: Implements business rules and logic.
  - **DataAccessLayer**: Manages data access and storage.
- **tests**: Contains unit tests for each layer.
